<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is an Active Directory home lab setup on a personal computer using VirtualBox. The goal is to simulate a domain environment with a Domain Controller running Windows Server 2019 and a client machine running Windows 10. The lab includes the configuration of Active Directory, DHCP, NAT, and Routing, as well as user account creation via PowerShell. The domain is configured as mydomain.com with a private network for communication between the Domain Controller and client machine. The project demonstrates networking, user management, and the interaction between different virtual machines within a controlled environment.
